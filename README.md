Done as an assignment to demonstrate CI/CD setup for a course at school.    
Set to be private after grading.  

## Operation
Shifting is an operation which replaces each letter in a string by the number of positions specified either up or down the alphabet.  
This app takes two strings, and a list of integers for each, shifts one "forward" (down the alphabet) and one "backwards" (up the alphabet) by the number specified, whose index in the list of integers corresponds to the index of the character in the string, then checks whether they are equal.  
(e.g shifting "abc" for the provided list of integers [1, 1, 2] forward, the result would be "bce").
